# Linux World Portfolio Projects

Build practical Linux systems. Solve realistic infrastructure problems. Produce evidence that can be reviewed, tested, discussed, and presented in a technical portfolio.

The Linux World project collection contains 30 portfolio projects across Junior, Mid-Level, and Senior levels. Each project begins with a business or technical problem and requires a working solution. The goal is not to copy commands. The goal is to understand the environment, make defensible engineering decisions, implement the system, test it, break it safely, recover it, and explain the result.

> A project is complete only when the system works, the required tests pass, the failure scenario is diagnosed, recovery is verified, and the documentation allows another learner to reproduce the result.

## What makes these portfolio projects

Every project produces reviewable engineering evidence:

- A defined problem and measurable outcome
- Requirements, assumptions, and constraints
- An architecture or system-flow diagram
- A reproducible Linux environment
- Commands, scripts, configuration files, and automation
- Security decisions and access controls
- Positive, negative, and failure testing
- Troubleshooting evidence and root-cause analysis
- Recovery and cleanup procedures
- A final case study, resume bullet, and interview discussion points

These are production-style laboratory projects. They demonstrate engineering methods in controlled environments. They must not be described as professional production experience unless the work was performed in an authorized production role.

## Choose a project level

| Level | Projects | Main focus | Recommended starting point |
|---|---:|---|---|
| [Junior](Junior/README.md) | 10 | Single-server administration, security, storage, services, Bash, monitoring, and troubleshooting | New Linux administrators and learners building their first technical portfolio |
| [Mid-Level](Mid-Level/README.md) | 10 | Multi-service and multi-server platforms, automation, centralized operations, containers, CI/CD, and incident response | Learners who can administer one Linux server independently |
| [Senior](Senior/README.md) | 10 | Architecture, high availability, identity, Kubernetes, observability, disaster recovery, performance, and reliability | Experienced administrators and infrastructure engineers ready to defend design trade-offs |

## Required project lifecycle

Every Linux World project follows the same engineering lifecycle.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P["Problem and requirements"] --> A["Architecture and plan"]
    A --> E["Prepare isolated environment"]
    E --> I["Implement in verified stages"]
    I --> S["Security and automation"]
    S --> T["Acceptance and negative tests"]
    T --> F["Controlled failure scenario"]
    F --> D["Diagnose and find root cause"]
    D --> R["Repair and verify recovery"]
    R --> O["Document results and evidence"]
```

The implementation guide must place each command beside its explanation, expected result, and verification command. Large scripts may be supplied as optional automation after the learner understands the manual implementation.

## Portfolio project standard

Every project must contain the following sections.

### 1. Problem

Describe the business or technical problem. Explain who is affected, what currently fails or is missing, and why the problem matters.

### 2. Requirements

Define functional requirements, security requirements, operational requirements, constraints, assumptions, and measurable acceptance criteria.

### 3. Architecture

Show the components, identities, network paths, storage paths, trust boundaries, dependencies, and expected data flow. The diagram must explain the system, not merely decorate the page.

### 4. Environment

State the supported distribution, version, VM or host requirements, CPU, memory, storage, network arrangement, packages, privileges, and snapshot requirements.

### 5. Implementation

Guide the learner through one controlled change at a time. Every important command must include:

- The directory from which it is executed
- The user or service identity that executes it
- Whether `sudo` is required
- A complete command or configuration file
- An explanation of the command, flags, variables, paths, and fields
- Representative expected output
- An independent verification command
- A checkpoint that must pass before continuing

### 6. Security

Explain identities, privileges, permissions, exposed services, firewall rules, authentication, secret handling, patching, auditability, and remaining risks.

### 7. Automation

Automate repeatable work with Bash, Python, Ansible, systemd timers, cron, or an appropriate platform tool. Automation must be safe to repeat or clearly describe its repeatability limits.

### 8. Testing

Include functional tests, security tests, negative tests, configuration validation, service checks, data-integrity checks, and final acceptance tests. Tests must inspect the real project result, not the existence of documentation files.

### 9. Failure scenario

Introduce a safe, deliberate, reversible failure. State the expected symptom and which acceptance check should fail.

### 10. Troubleshooting

Use an evidence-led investigation:

```text
symptom
  -> blast radius
  -> recent changes
  -> metrics, logs, events, processes, sockets, files, and configuration
  -> competing hypotheses
  -> smallest safe test
  -> root cause
  -> mitigation
  -> repair
  -> recovery verification
  -> prevention
```

### 11. Documentation

Include a runbook, change record, decision record, troubleshooting notes, cleanup procedure, and enough information for another learner to reproduce the system.

### 12. Results

Compare the final result with the original acceptance criteria. Include measured evidence, remaining limitations, lessons learned, and what would change in a real production environment.

### 13. Resume bullet

Write a concise, truthful bullet describing what was designed, implemented, automated, secured, tested, and measured. Identify the work as a laboratory or portfolio project when appropriate.

### 14. Interview questions

Prepare questions that test design reasoning, Linux knowledge, failure diagnosis, trade-offs, security decisions, and recovery understanding.

## Junior Linux portfolio projects

Junior projects build confidence operating one Linux server. They provide the most detailed implementation guidance, but learners must still explain every important decision and prove the result.

## Evidence requirements

Screenshots alone are not sufficient. A strong submission should contain:

- Distribution, kernel, lab topology, and resource information
- Architecture and trust-boundary diagrams
- Learner-authored scripts and configuration files
- Selected command output with timestamps and context
- Passing acceptance tests
- A failing test during the controlled failure
- Diagnostic evidence supporting the root cause
- Successful recovery tests
- Security test results
- Before-and-after measurements where relevant
- Decision records explaining important trade-offs
- A final case study and lessons learned

Evidence must use synthetic names, domains, addresses, users, and data. Remove passwords, tokens, keys, private addresses, cloud identifiers, personal information, employer information, and customer data before committing.

## Progression rules

### Junior to Mid-Level

Complete at least eight Junior projects, including projects from administration, security, storage, automation, monitoring, and troubleshooting. At least two should be published as complete portfolio case studies.

### Mid-Level to Senior

Complete at least eight Mid-Level projects. Demonstrate multi-server administration, repeatable automation, security testing, failure recovery, and operational documentation.

### Senior completion

Complete projects across high availability, identity, observability, disaster recovery, security, automation, performance, and incident response. Defend the architecture and trade-offs in writing or a recorded technical walkthrough.

## Safety rules

- Use disposable virtual machines or isolated laboratory infrastructure.
- Never test destructive storage, firewall, authentication, malware, denial-of-service, or failure-injection procedures on production or shared systems.
- Take snapshots before boot, storage, identity, firewall, SSH, package, or systemd changes.
- Confirm the host, device, path, mount point, process, port, and identity before modifying them.
- Use resource limits for stress and performance work.
- Preserve a console or snapshot recovery path before changing remote access.
- Read cleanup commands before execution.
- Stop when a target is ambiguous.

## How to present a completed project

A public portfolio case study should answer these questions:

1. What problem was being solved?
2. What requirements and constraints shaped the design?
3. What architecture was selected, and why?
4. How was the environment implemented and secured?
5. What was automated?
6. How was the solution tested?
7. What failure was introduced?
8. What evidence identified the root cause?
9. How was service recovered and verified?
10. What measurable result was achieved?
11. What limitations remain?
12. What would change in a real production environment?

## Completion is evidence, not activity

Watching a tutorial is not project completion. Running commands without understanding them is not project completion. A service showing `active` is not enough when the application is unhealthy. A backup is not complete until restoration succeeds. Monitoring is not complete until an alert is tested. High availability is not complete until failover is observed. Incident response is not complete until recovery is verified and prevention work is documented.

The standard is simple:

> Design it. Build it. Secure it. Automate it. Test it. Break it safely. Diagnose it. Recover it. Prove it. Explain it.

## Contribution standard

New projects and major project changes must preserve the portfolio standard. Contributions should add reproducible engineering value, not another unreviewed command list. Every submitted project must include safe scope, supported environment, implementation guidance, acceptance tests, a controlled failure, recovery verification, cleanup, evidence requirements, and source attribution where applicable.

Use the repository contribution, security, support, resource, and licensing policies before submitting changes.
