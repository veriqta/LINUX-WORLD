# Deep Performance and Resource Isolation: Commands and Options

## 1. Explain and safely use `ps -eLo pid,tid,psr,cls,rtprio,ni,stat,comm`

**Model answer:** `ps -eLo pid,tid,psr,cls,rtprio,ni,stat,comm` takes a process snapshot. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 2. Explain and safely use `taskset -cp PID`

**Model answer:** `taskset -cp PID` reads or changes CPU affinity. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 3. Explain and safely use `numastat -p PID`

**Model answer:** `numastat -p PID` shows NUMA allocation and locality. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 4. Explain and safely use `memory.stat`

**Model answer:** `memory.stat` inspects or operates the memory.stat subsystem. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 5. Explain and safely use `io.stat`

**Model answer:** `io.stat` inspects or operates the io.stat subsystem. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 6. Explain and safely use `perf record`

**Model answer:** `perf record` uses kernel performance counters and sampling. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.
