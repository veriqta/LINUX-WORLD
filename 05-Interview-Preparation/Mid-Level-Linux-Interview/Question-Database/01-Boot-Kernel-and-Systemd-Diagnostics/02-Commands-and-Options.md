# Boot Kernel and Systemd Diagnostics: Commands and Options

## 1. Explain and safely use `journalctl -b -1`

**Model answer:** `journalctl -b -1` queries the systemd journal. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 2. Explain and safely use `cat /proc/cmdline`

**Model answer:** `cat /proc/cmdline` reads file content. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 3. Explain and safely use `systemctl --failed`

**Model answer:** `systemctl --failed` inspects or changes systemd unit state. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 4. Explain and safely use `systemctl list-dependencies --reverse UNIT`

**Model answer:** `systemctl list-dependencies --reverse UNIT` inspects or changes systemd unit state. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 5. Explain and safely use `systemd-analyze critical-chain`

**Model answer:** `systemd-analyze critical-chain` examines boot, unit verification and security properties. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 6. Explain and safely use `lsinitrd or lsinitramfs`

**Model answer:** `lsinitrd or lsinitramfs` inspects or operates the lsinitrd subsystem. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.
