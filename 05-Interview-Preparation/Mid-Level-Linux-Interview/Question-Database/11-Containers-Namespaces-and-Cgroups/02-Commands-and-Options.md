# Containers Namespaces and Cgroups: Commands and Options

## 1. Explain and safely use `lsns`

**Model answer:** `lsns` lists Linux namespaces. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 2. Explain and safely use `nsenter`

**Model answer:** `nsenter` runs a command in selected namespaces. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 3. Explain and safely use `systemd-cgls`

**Model answer:** `systemd-cgls` shows the cgroup hierarchy. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 4. Explain and safely use `cat /proc/PID/cgroup`

**Model answer:** `cat /proc/PID/cgroup` reads file content. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 5. Explain and safely use `capsh --print`

**Model answer:** `capsh --print` inspects Linux capabilities. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 6. Explain and safely use `podman inspect CONTAINER`

**Model answer:** `podman inspect CONTAINER` manages OCI containers and images. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 7. Explain and safely use `crictl ps`

**Model answer:** `crictl ps` inspects CRI container runtimes. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.
