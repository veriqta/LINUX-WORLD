**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 2. Explain and safely use `getent passwd USER`

**Model answer:** `getent passwd USER` queries the configured name-service path. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 3. Explain and safely use `getent group GROUP`

**Model answer:** `getent group GROUP` queries the configured name-service path. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

## 4. Explain and safely use `namei -l PATH`

**Model answer:** `namei -l PATH` shows permissions along every path component. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 5. Explain and safely use `stat -c "%U %G %a" FILE`

**Model answer:** `stat -c "%U %G %a" FILE` shows inode metadata. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 6. Explain and safely use `sudo -l`

**Model answer:** `sudo -l` runs an authorized command under policy. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

## 7. Explain and safely use `umask`

**Model answer:** `umask` shows or changes the creation mask. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.
