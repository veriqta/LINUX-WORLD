# Packages Software and Repositories: Commands and Options

## 1. Explain and safely use `apt-cache policy PKG`

**Model answer:** `apt-cache policy PKG` queries APT metadata without changing packages. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 2. Explain and safely use `dpkg -L PKG`

**Model answer:** `dpkg -L PKG` queries or changes Debian packages. Before using it, confirm the target, required privilege, expected output and side effects. A complete answer interprets the relevant fields and names the next test rather than merely listing the command.

**Interviewer checks:** The candidate explains the command name, every important option and argument, privilege, read or write behavior, variable output, exit status, one verification method and one safer alternative when relevant.

**Lab challenge:** Run a read-only form, save sanitized output, identify three meaningful fields and explain the next command that the result justifies.

## 3. Explain and safely use `dnf info PKG`
