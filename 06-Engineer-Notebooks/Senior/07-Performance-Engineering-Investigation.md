# Performance Engineering Investigation

Prove a performance bottleneck across application and Linux layers.

> **Notebook level:** Senior · **Record status:** Draft / Active / Complete / Superseded

## When to use this notebook

Use this record when the work requires a durable, reviewable account. Link existing tickets, incidents, changes or decisions instead of duplicating their complete contents. Use only authorized systems and sanitize every public example.

### Experiment design

| Experiment | Controlled variable | Workload | Baseline | Expected signal | Observed | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Coverage requirement:** Use reproducible workloads, profiles and latency distributions; separate correlation, contention and causation.

**Decision or escalation produced by this worksheet:**

## Before-state evidence

## Verification

| Requirement | Verification method | Expected | Observed | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary behavior | | | | | Pass / Fail |
| Negative or denied behavior | | | | | Pass / Fail |
| Security control | | | | | Pass / Fail |
| Dependency health | | | | | Pass / Fail |
| Persistence | | | | | Pass / Fail / Not applicable |
| Monitoring and logs | | | | | Pass / Fail |

## Risk checks

- [ ] Risk reviewed: Coordinated omission.
- [ ] Risk reviewed: Global tuning first.
- [ ] Risk reviewed: No control group.
- [ ] Risk reviewed: Optimizing average only.
- [ ] No unrelated system was changed.
- [ ] No secret or personal data appears in the record.

**Compatibility or data limits:**

**Rollback verification:**

**Fallback if rollback fails:**

## Communication and escalation

| UTC time | Audience | Message or decision | Owner | Next update |

## Final state

**Outcome:** Successful / Partially successful / Failed / Rolled back / Superseded

**User-visible result:**

**Remaining risk or limitation:**

**Follow-up owner and due date:**

**Review date:**

## Closeout quality gate

- [ ] The final state is independently verified.
- [ ] Evidence supports every material claim.
- [ ] Commands and timestamps are understandable to another engineer.
- [ ] Rollback, recovery or cleanup is complete.
- [ ] Temporary access and files are removed.
- [ ] Monitoring shows no delayed regression.
- [ ] Follow-up actions have owners and dates.
- [ ] Public content is fully redacted.
